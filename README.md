# Rotating-Fan-Platform-Arduino
Rotating platform for desk cooling fan to convert static USB desk fan into oscilating fan on a budget. Using an Arduino Nano Compatible board with a servo and IR controller.

Infrared controller is used to control the servo speed, pattern, direction & power. The servo is used to oscilate a flat platform upon which the desk fan sits.

Oscilating fans provide a better cooling effect than static fans and this was a simple solution to turn a USB static desk fan into a oscilating fan on a budget.
